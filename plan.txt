Create a website to log builds of springer blaster for the blaster hobby enthusiasts.
I did not have any time to work on the prototype due to health issues, and I feel bad about not being able to do more for the prototype.
I want to visit during office hours in order to get some more understanding on the content and actually do the project properly.

Features:
A list of most standard springers in the blaster hobby.
Springs, barrels/ barrel materials, fps numbers, and rifling with overall accuracy

Store these user created builds to be referenced back to later.

Use a UI that allows for personal input or a dropdown of various other methods
Use Bulma probably lol

still need to integrate with Heroku and get my educational account from github
